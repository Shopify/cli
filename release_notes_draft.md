<!--
If your feature is significant enough that CLI users will want to know about it,
write a short summary sentence here. This is a draft document and will be
finalized when a new minor version is released.

Notes should look like this:

# App

* ***A cool thing.*** Rather than doing the annoying thing you used to do, you can
now do a different and much cooler thing.
* ***A faster thing.*** The `command` command was sped up by 3x in most cases.

# Theme

* ***Another cool thing.*** You get the idea by now.
-->

# App

* ***JS functions.*** JavaScript functions are now available! You can learn more
in the docs: https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/functions/language-support/javascript
* ***Custom ports for `app dev`.*** You can now define custom ports for the
frontend or backend processes of the app.
* ***Theme app extension logs.*** Logs for theme app extensions will no longer
appear in a separate area and conflict with other logs or the preview/quit bar.
Instead, they will be integrated with the other logs. Progress bars have been
replaced with static output to accommodate this placement.
* ***Customer accounts UI extension preview.*** The link from the dev console for
Customer Accounts UI Extensions will now redirect to the customer account page.

# Theme

* ***Theme environments.*** Configure environments with theme and store in a
`shopify.theme.toml` file in your project root. Use the `--environment` flag (or
`-e` for short) to switch between environments. For more details, read the docs
at https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/cli/environments
* ***Fix: Clean up errors on theme dev.*** Analytics requests were causing many
errors in both the CLI and Chrome consoles. These requests have been stubbed out.
* ***Fix: 422 error on theme dev.*** Truncate the development theme name to â‰¤ 50
characters, preventing a 422 error.
* ***Fix: `Ruby is required to continue`.*** Eliminate error where the CLI can't
find the ruby executable.
* ***Fix: gem install permissions issues.*** Use a local directory for gem
installations, avoiding permissions issues users experienced when installing to
their system gem directory.

# UI (applicable across project types)

* ***Resizable select prompts.*** The height of select prompts adjusts to the
height of the terminal, so that prompts won't be cut off in shorter terminals.
* ***Fix: Log output utf8 support.*** Special characters were appearing strangely
in subprocess logs, now they are correctly rendered using utf8.
* ***Fix: Duplicated taskbar.*** Swallow return key presses so they don't cause
the rainbow taskbar to be duplicated.
* ***Fix: Dev footer duplicates on resize.*** The persistent footer for `app dev`
would self-duplicate on terminal window resize. It is now displayed correctly.
* ***Fix: Narrow terminal support.*** Previously certain UI elements would look
strange in very narrow terminals, such as in CI tools. Now we enforce a minimum
of 20 characters' width, which is much easier to read.
