<!--
If your feature is significant enough that CLI users will want to know about it,
write a short summary sentence here. This is a draft document and will be
finalized when a new minor version is released.

Notes should look like this:

# App

* *A cool thing.* Rather than doing the annoying thing you used to do, you can
now do a different and much cooler thing.
* *A faster thing.* The `command` command was sped up by 3x in most cases.

# Theme

* *Another cool thing.* You get the idea by now.
-->

# App

* Adapt the height of select prompts to the height of the terminal so that prompts won't be cut off in shorter terminals.
