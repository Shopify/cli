<!--
If your feature is significant enough that CLI users will want to know about it,
write a short summary sentence here. This is a draft document and will be
finalized when a new minor version is released.

Notes should look like this:

# App

* ***A cool thing.*** Rather than doing the annoying thing you used to do, you can
now do a different and much cooler thing.
* ***A faster thing.*** The `command` command was sped up by 3x in most cases.

# Theme

* ***Another cool thing.*** You get the idea by now.
-->

* ***No-color mode.*** You can use the `NO_COLOR=1` environment variable or
`--no-color` flag to disable color in the CLI. Note that there is only partial
support for some commands thus far.
