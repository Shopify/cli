# Release process

## Process

### Adding change sets when opening PRs

When changing any of the packages of the repository,
you'll have to run `yarn changeset add`,
and [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) will guide you through the process of adding your changes to be included in the next version's changelog.
Note that if you skip this step when you open a PR,
CI will fail and prevent you from merging the PR.

### Creating a new version
The steps are:
1. Locate the [opened PR](https://github.com/Shopify/cli/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+in%3Atitle+%22Version+Packages%22) named **Version Packages**. This PR is automatically created with the first merge in main after a previous release is published. _Changesets_ will automatically detect changes with each merge to main and update automatically the PR and consequently the package.jsons and the dependencies between them
2. Verify that the correct version is updated in every _package.json_, <ins>paying special attention that there is no **major** bump</ins>.
3. Run `pnpm install` to update the `pnpm-lock.yaml` for the fixtures app and commit the change to that branch
4. Merge the **Version Packages** PR when all checks have passed
5. Wait until the commit for **Version Packages** becomes <font color="gree">green</font> in [CLI Production Shipit](https://shipit.shopify.io/shopify/cli/production) and push the _Deploy_ button.
6. Click the _Create deploy_ button to start the deployment. Two main tasks are executed:
    1. Creation of the [extensions binary release](https://github.com/Shopify/cli/releases) in Github. In case an error occurs at this step, there are two possible situations:
       * The release is not created: Retry again from _step 3_
       * Some of the binaries are not correctly uploaded to the release: The release should be deleted manually from Github and then retry again from _step 3_
    2. Publishing of the CLI packages to the [NPM registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/cli). In case an error is produced the extension binary release should be deleted manually from Github and retry again from _step 3_
7. Once the deployment completes, [find the PR](https://github.com/Shopify/homebrew-shopify/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+Shopify+CLI) in the homebrew-shopify repository and merge the changes in the formula.
8. Go through all the [PRs labeled with `includes-post-release-steps`](https://github.com/Shopify/cli/issues?q=label%3Aincludes-post-release-steps+is%3Aclosed) and follow the post-release steps described in those PRs. Delete the labels afterward.
