# Contributors documentation

This page contains resources for people interested in contributing to this repository or developing a [plugin](./plugins.md)](./plugins.md).

## CLI

The Shopify CLI is a tool for merchants, partners, and developers to interact with the platform from their terminals. Its technical design allows adding features horizontally through [**plugins**](#plugins) that build on [**cli-kit**](#cli-kit). [@shopify/theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/theme), [@shopify/app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/app), [@shopify/cli-hydrogen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/cli-hydrogen) are examples of plugins to develop themes, apps, and hydrogen storefronts, respectively.

The list below contains valuable resources for people interested in contributing to the CLI project in this repository.

## CLI Kit

The [`@shopify/cli-kit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/cli-kit) NPM package provides utilities to abstract away interactions with the Shopify platform (e.g., authentication, API requests) and ensures experiences are consistent across the board. If you are creating a new plugin or contributing to an existing one, we recommend checking out the following resources:

- [Errors](cli-kit/errors.md)
- [Command Guidelines](cli-kit/command-guidelines.md)
- [UI Guidelines](cli-kit/ui-kit/guidelines.md)
- [Contributing to UI Kit](cli-kit/ui-kit/contributing.md)

## Plugins

[Plugins](./cli/plugins.md) are NPM packages that extend, customize, and augment core CLI functionality. Some plugins are developed by Shopify (included in the list below), and we refer to them as official plugins, while external developers develop others. If you want to develop a plugin, we recommend checking out the resources in the development section below.
