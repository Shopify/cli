With the Shopify command line interface (Shopify CLI 3.0), you can:
- build custom storefronts and manage their hosting
- initialize, build, dev, and deploy Shopify apps ‚Äî and generate app extensions

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Before you begin ###

Install the latest version of  [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started) (or another package manager of your choice).

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Developing apps with Shopify CLI

When you‚Äôre building a Shopify app, you can initialize your project using your preferred package manager. A single command will install all the dependencies you need ‚Äî including Shopify CLI itself.

Initialize your project using one of the following commands:
- `npm init @shopify/app@latest` (installed by default with Node)
- `pnpm create @shopify/create-app@latest`
- `yarn create @shopify/app`

Learn more in the docs: [Create an app](https://shopify.dev/apps/getting-started/create)

## Developing Hydrogen custom storefronts with Shopify CLI ##

When you‚Äôre building a custom storefront, use Hydrogen, Shopify‚Äôs React-based framework optimized for headless commerce. Initialize a new Hydrogen app with a fully-featured Demo Store template, or start from scratch with the minimal Hello World template. Shopify Plus stores can deploy their Hydrogen apps to Oxygen, Shopify‚Äôs global hosting solution, at no extra cost.

Get started using one of the following commands:
- `npm init @shopify/hydrogen@latest`
- `npx @shopify/create-hydrogen@latest`
- `pnpm create @shopify/create-hydrogen@latest`
- `yarn create @shopify/hydrogen`
