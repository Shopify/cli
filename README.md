With the Shopify command line interface (Shopify CLI 3.0), you can:
- initialize, build, dev, and deploy Shopify apps, extensions, functions and themes
- build custom storefronts and manage their hosting

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Before you begin ###

Install the latest version of  [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started) (or another package manager of your choice).

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Developing apps with Shopify CLI

When you‚Äôre building a Shopify app, you can initialize your project using your preferred package manager. A single command will install all the dependencies you need ‚Äî including Shopify CLI itself.

Initialize your project using one of the following commands:
- `npm init @shopify/app@latest` (installed by default with Node)
- `pnpm create @shopify/create-app@latest`
- `yarn create @shopify/app`

- `npm install -g @shopify/cli @shopify/theme`

You can also use do it through Homebrew on macOS: `brew install shopify-cli`
