'@shopify/theme': patch
---

Editor shortcut (e) will now navigate to your most recently viewed template

Hitting `e` while your server is running (`shopify theme dev`) will now open
the theme editor in the Admin to the most recently rendered template that you
viewed in the browser (e.g. if you have multiple tabs open it will use the
one that was rendered most recently).
