## App

- Added CLI support for extensions.supported_features in toml [#6765](https://github.com/Shopify/cli/pull/6765)
- Enable custom headers in CLI GraphiQL. Users can now set custom headers like Shopify-Search-Query-Debug=1 in the GraphiQL interface to pass debugging headers to the Admin API [#6703](https://github.com/Shopify/cli/pull/6703)

## Theme

- Fix shopify theme dev --theme-editor-sync to avoid deleting files during race conditions, especially when multiple changes come from an external process (e.g., AI coding tools) [#6784](https://github.com/Shopify/cli/pull/6784)
