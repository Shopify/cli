## CLI
-   Add HTTP proxy support with the environment variables `SHOPIFY_HTTP_PROXY` and `SHOPIFY_HTTPS_PROXY`

    If your proxy uses basic authentication, provide the auth in the following format:

    ```bash
    SHOPIFY_HTTP_PROXY=http://user:pass@yourproxy.com:PORT
    ```

## App

-   Fix the first import in shopify.d.ts to be a relative path
-   Fix the globalThis type

## Theme

-   Update 'shopify theme check'
-   Fix requests to Section Rendering API that contain the same search param name multiple times (e.g. multiple filters for "size").
-   Fixed an issue where CLI would not apply the SHOPIFY_FLAG_ENVIRONMENT flag
