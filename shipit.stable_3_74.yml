    # 1. Replace the previous line with this, replacing 3.x with the actual version:
    #    - bash -i -c "npm_config_loglevel=verbose pnpm changeset publish --tag stable-3.x"
    #    This will prevent publishes from being tagged as latest.
    # 2. Remove the following 2 lines, which update Homebrew and Shopify.dev docs
