/**
This is the entry point to start watching events in an app. This process has 3 steps:
1. The file system watcher (file-watcher.ts) will detect changes in the file system and emit events.
2. The app-event-watcher (this file) will receive the events and process them, reloading the app if necessary.
3. The consumer of the processed events will receive the updated app and the affected extensions.

Since an extension folder can contain multiple extensions defined in the same toml, all file system events can
potentially affect multiple extensions, an AppEvent will always include an array with all affected extensions.

Examples:
1. A file is updated in an extension folder (/extensions/my_extension/index.js)
 -> file-watcher will emit a `file_updated` event
  -> app-event-watcher will determine that all extensions in the `my_extension` directory are affected
    -> The consumer will receive the updated app and the affected extension(s)

2. A new directory is created in the extensions folder (/extensions/new_extension)
  -> file-watcher will emit a `extension_folder_created` event
    -> app-event-watcher will determine that an extension(s) was(were) created and reload the app
      -> The consumer will receive the updated app and the created extension(s)

3. A directory is removed from the file system (/extensions/my_extension)
  -> file-watcher will emit a `extension_folder_deleted` event
    -> app-event-watcher will determine that all extensions in `my_extension` were deleted and remove them from the app
      -> The consumer will receive the updated app and the deleted extension(s)

4. A toml file is updated (/extensions/my_extension/extension.toml)
  -> file-watcher will emit a `extensions_config_updated` event
    -> app-event-watcher will compare the old and new extensions to determine which were created, deleted or updated
      -> The consumer will receive the updated app and the created, deleted and updated extensions

5. The app.toml is updated
  -> file-watcher will emit a `extensions_config_updated` event
    -> app-event-watcher will compare the old and new config to determine which extensions were created, deleted or updated
      -> The consumer will receive the updated app and the created, deleted and updated extensions
