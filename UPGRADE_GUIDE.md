<!--
THIS FILE IS A LAST RESORT. DO NOT BREAK THINGS FOR USERS.

If users need to do any explicit steps to upgrade to a new version due to broken
backwards compatibility, this is the place to mention it.

Again, if this file has any content, something has gone wrong.

It should look like this:

# Apps

## 3.89

* Version 3.89 no longer supports TOML files. Instead, we have moved to the
battle-tested technology of XML. To upgrade automatically, navigate to the
root of your app and run `npm shopify migrate-app-toml-to-xml`.

But seriously, PLEASE DO NOT MAKE THIS FILE NECESSARY.
